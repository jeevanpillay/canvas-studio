# Canvas Studio

Canvas Studio is an open-source utility that empowers artists and developers to create captivating art using the HTML Canvas element. This project is designed as a development dependency, allowing you to run custom canvas scripts externally. You can write your canvas artwork in a separate script file, and Canvas Studio will execute it, generating the canvas output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Install Canvas Studio as a development dependency in your project:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev canvas-studio
   ```

## Usage

Canvas Studio is meant to be integrated into your existing projects. Here's how you can use it:

1. Create a new JavaScript file in your project directory, e.g., `my-artwork.js`.

2. Write your custom canvas script in `my-artwork.js`. You have full creative control to draw shapes, apply colors, gradients, patterns, and more using the HTML Canvas API.

   ```javascript
   // my-artwork.js
   const canvas = document.getElementById('my-canvas')
   const context = canvas.getContext('2d')

   // Your canvas drawing code here
   context.fillStyle = 'blue'
   context.fillRect(10, 10, 100, 100)
   ```

3. In your project's `package.json` file, add a script to run Canvas Studio:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "generate-canvas": "canvas-studio my-artwork.js"
   }
   ```

## Creating Your Canvas Art

In the `my-artwork.js` file, you can customize your canvas by writing JavaScript code that utilizes the HTML Canvas API. Be as creative as you like to produce unique artwork. This file will serve as your canvas script.

## Running Canvas Studio

To generate the canvas output from your canvas script, run the following command:

```bash
npm run generate-canvas
```

This command will execute `my-artwork.js` using Canvas Studio and create the canvas artwork.
